    //todo Welcome to the theory!
    // To start put these classes into my.project.controller.theory so you can check these using swagger or browser
    // Each team member has to do only 1 assignment and commit/push it to your repository.
    // (So 2 people - 2 assignments, 3 people - 3 assignments, 4 people - 4 assignments).
    // Make sure to commit under your user otherwise the points won't count. Each team member has to score at least 50%.
    // Don't add unnecessary code (no need for services or database).
    // We are doing mock-api design. I am grading urls and structure of the methods.
    // It should still work, i.e I can access this api from swagger or browser.
    // A good source for learning about proper API design is https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/best-practices/api-design

    //todo The Story
    // Chris is a coin collector. (Numismatic is the official term)
    // ---
    // I have 1 000 different coins from the Ancient Greek to the Modern Estonian euros.
    // I used to travel a lot with my coin collection. Do you know how many times have I had an exhibition in Telliskivi?
    // I used to travel, not anymore. Have you heard of corona?
    // Anyways I want to develop a web page for my coins so myself and my friends can view my collection wherever they are.
    // I need to have like a list view with many coins. If I click on a single coin, I get to a detail page.
    // I want to add new coins, update existing ones and occasionally delete some.
    // There should be some filtering, by period and region.
    // And sorting, by value and dateAdded. By default it can sort with latest coins first.
    //
    //todo A first things first, please add necessary annotations to this class

    //todo B "I need to have like a list view with many coins"
    // create a method to query coins (plural)

    // H modify correct method to filter by region (americas, europe)
    // make sure existing functionality doesn't break

    //todo I-J "And sorting, by value and date added. By default it can sort with latest coins first."

    // J modify correct method to support sorting in ascending and descending order
